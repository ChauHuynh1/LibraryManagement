1. INTRODUCTION
One short paragraph to describe what this software is about.

QuickLib is a user-friendly program which enables librarians to access to the library's member and item database. An item can either be a book, a journal or a DVD. A book has a title, authors, edition, publication, year, ISBN (13 or 10 digits), language, subject, and status (available or on loan) A journal has a title, publication, year, ISSN (8 digits), language, subject, and status. A DVD has a title, authors, publication, year, language, subject, and status. A member has full name, ID (a driverâ€™s license number or a passport number), phone, email, address, expired date (same as the expired date of the ID provided), and status (active or expired).

3. DESIGN
Describe major design decisions and major algorithms.

Firstly, search Item is based on the searching habit of the author. It will ask which type the user want to search first, and check if the keyword searching exist.
Secondly, add and update Item is also mostly same with searching. It will ask which type the user want to add or update first, and check if that item is already exist to eleminate the duplication. And program will ask if the user want to save or not. In the search, register and update is all the same with search, add and update Item.

4. INSTALLATION
InteliJ IDEA Ultimate
Java JDK 11


5. KNOWN BUGS
Date: in the beginning, the date when the user enter are not checked properly:
For example: If user enter 29/99/2020 this program still thinks that is correct!
A reference for this date checking is found so this problem is solved!

ISSN: this ISSN number is only check whether it contains 8 digit or not when it is entered.
After that, in order to solve this problem an algorithms for checking ISSN is found so that this problem is solved.
